# python-keylogger
Simple python keylogger for computers and society class, it needs the pynput-master plugin to be setup for it to be functional

Here is the link to the plugin that needs to be setup with this python file in order to be functional

https://github.com/moses-palmer/pynput

In the project folder of the keylogger, there should be a pynput-master folder, a logger.pyw file, and a new file created after the script is ran called key_log.txt.

Any key strokes will be recorded into key_log.txt.

In order to stop the program once launched, go into task manager and end the Python task.

Thank you.
